Issues/Enhancements:
- User not able to update profile details, only user account details - DONE
- If user email is updated, updated email is sent to new email not old - DONE
- Emails sent should use an HTML template - Thymeleaf
- When catching exceptions, throw specific exceptions not general ones - WIP
- Kafka producer to be able to send any object
- Check all pom.xml and remove unused dependency and separate test and runtimes
- Batch Process adds duplicate dates for gold price history - BUG
- batch service, maybe use JPA instead of JDBCTemplate?
- If processed file exists in table, do not run batch import until the table is cleared - add new column for table affected default null
- have url constants in own class - for each controller - DONE
- add swagger docs for endpoints
- When notification service checks if user id exists to add a notification. No check to see if account is active/has push notifications enabled - DONE
- Different profiles, testing, dev and prod

Performance Testing:
- VisualVM
- Apache JMeter

Can be analysed after above is complete:
- DB Indexes
- Caching
- Kafka Configurations(with and without SSL)

Refactor:
pricing-service

@ServiceConnect - applies connection details to spring automatically
@Container - restarts the container for each instance needed i.e. per test class
